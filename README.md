# EasyLog - A Simple Logging Utility for Android

EasyLog is a lightweight and easy-to-use logging utility for Android applications. It provides a simple API for logging messages at different levels of severity (debug, info, error, verbose) with concise syntax.

## Features

- Easy-to-use API for logging messages
- Supports logging at different levels of severity
- Lightweight and efficient
- Supports filtering log messages in logcat
- Suitable for both development and production environments

**Advanced Features:**
- Automatically captures the class and line number of the log call site.
- Displays the data type of the logged object.
- Log messages are formatted for easy readability in Logcat.

## Installation

To use EasyLog in your Android project, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.example:easylog:1.0.0'
```

## Usage

### Initialization

Before using EasyLog, you need to initialize it in your application class or root MainActivity with a custom log tag. 
This step is optional; if not provided, the default tag "EASY-LOG" will be used.

```kotlin
EasyLog.setup("CustomTag")
```

### Logging Messages

EasyLog provides concise methods for logging messages at different levels of severity. Log messages are automatically formatted for easy readability in Logcat, including the class and line number of the log call site and the data type of the logged object.

```kotlin
// Log integer value
123.logD("Integer: ")

// Log double value
123.0.logD("Double: ")

// Log string value
"John".logD("String: ")

// Log boolean value
true.logD("Boolean: ")

// Log without any arguments
"Default Log".log()
```

## Viewing Logs with Logcat

To view logs generated by EasyLog in Logcat, filter the log messages using the custom log tag specified during initialization. For example, if you initialized EasyLog with the tag "CustomTag", you can filter log messages in Logcat using the following command:

```
adb logcat -s CustomTag
```

This command will display only the log messages generated by EasyLog with the specified tag (CustomTag) in this case for example.

```kotlin
2024-06-01 12:03:53.325 27193 CustomTag: Integer: 123 (MainActivity.kt:77) // assuming the log was called from MainActivity line 77
2024-06-01 12:03:53.325 27193 CustomTag: Double: 123.0 (MainViewModel.kt:78) // assuming the log was called from MainViewModel line 78
2024-06-01 12:03:53.325 27193 CustomTag: String: John (MainRepository.kt:79) // assuming the log was called from MainRepository line 79
2024-06-01 12:03:53.326 27193 CustomTag: Boolean: true (HomeScreenComposable.kt:80) // assuming the log was called from HomeScreenComposable line 80
2024-06-01 12:03:53.326 27193 CustomTag: String: Default Log (HomeScreenComposable.kt:12) // assuming the log was called from HomeScreenComposable line 12

// each source i.e. (MainActivity.kt:77) for example... are clickable.
```
